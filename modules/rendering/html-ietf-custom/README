HTML-IETF-CUSTOM
Version: 1.0.2
Created: July 2, 2021
Updated: November 15, 2021

- Description: -----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a custom rendering plugin created for the IETF wiki.js instance(s). The
intent is that any references to RFC's or Internet Drafts are automatically
linked to their corresponding Datatracker page.

For example, if a user were to type `rfc 64` during the page creation or
modification phase on any wiki page, when the page is rendered an <a href/> tag
is added around that text with a link to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc64/

Similarly, were a user to reference a draft like `draft-ietf-taps-impl-05`, the
page would be rendered with an <a href/> tag around that text with a link to
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-taps-impl/05/

There are several times we intentionally do not add a link:
- Inside of a link (<a href> tag)
- Inside of a header tag (<h[1-9])
- Inside of any code blocks (<code>)

- Installation: ----------------------------------------------------------------
To install, copy the folder html-ietf-custom/ and its contents to any running
wiki.js installation at your-wiki-path/server/modules/rendering/

*Please note that the name of the folder cannot change without also changing
the name of the module. Changing one or the other without care will break your
wiki.js instance.

After confirming the files have been copied, all that is needed is to restart
wiki.js (systemctl restart wiki) and the module is enabled by default.

- Testing: ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites
	Need to install jest: `npm i -g jest`

You can run all tests for the wiki.js project by running `jest` from any of the
directories in this project, or you can run `jest IETF` to run just the tests
specific to this module.
